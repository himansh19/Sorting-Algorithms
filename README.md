# Sorting-Algorithms 
In this repository 
1. we will write code of various Sorting Algorithm in Python
   
2. We will also be performing analysis of these algorithm i.e how time increases with increase in input size and compare with all sorting algos
   
3. Code of Analysis is also mentioned in individual sort code file at the end for which the result is also plotted and screenshot of result is also attached below


For performing all of this, below python libraries you need to import before running code as they will be used 
import timeit

import random

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import numpy as np
